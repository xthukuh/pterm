## PTERM

#

A PHP/HTML/JS terminal emulator.

**Runs on any PHP server and accessed from any web browser.**

> This provides a simple html interface where you can execute php, composer, and other commands directly from the browser. The commands are executed on a separate resumable cached process thread with output logs.

*This is especially useful when no terminal access is available like in the case of shared/limited user apache server.*
